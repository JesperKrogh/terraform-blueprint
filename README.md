# terraform-blueprint

This repository contains blueprint for running Ceph on AWS
This can be used for spinning up a test-cluster to take a good 
run of http://ceph.io. 

One could ask "why would you ever want to do this"? 

Purpose could be:

* Get hands-on experience managing a Ceph cluster - Grow, Shrink, updgrade, etc. 
* Performance test Ceph (compare to local storage allready in place) 

Current version is compatible with ceph-ansible/stable-5.0 branch and runs on Ubuntu 18.04 
(Still work in progress) 

More blueprints may be added over time.
